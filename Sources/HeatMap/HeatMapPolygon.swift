import CoreLocation

/// A single contour polygon representing an iso-density region.
///
/// Each contour has a ``level`` index (0 = lowest density), a density
/// ``threshold``, and an array of geographic ``coordinates`` forming
/// a closed polygon.
///
/// You don't create `HeatMapPolygon` values directly. Instead, access
/// them through ``HeatMapContours/contours`` after computing contours:
///
/// ```swift
/// let result = try await HeatMapContours.compute(from: points)
/// for contour in result.contours {
///     print("Level \(contour.level): \(contour.coordinates.count) vertices")
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The contour geometry is useful for advanced use cases such as hit
/// testing, exporting polygon data, or building custom visualizations
/// outside of ``HeatMapLayer``.
///
/// ## Topics
///
/// ### Identifying the Contour
///
/// - ``id``
/// - ``level``
/// - ``threshold``
///
/// ### Accessing Geometry
///
/// - ``coordinates``
///
/// ### Geometry Queries
///
/// - ``contains(_:)``
